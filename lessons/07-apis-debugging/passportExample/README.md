# Passport.js Example App

This is an example app using passport for facebook login. 

## Setup Auth

The app requires an `auth.js` file to load the Facebook auth information from.  All it needs to do is export the information:

```
module.exports = {
    'FACEBOOK_APP_ID' : 'YOUR APP ID HERE',
    'FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET' : 'YOUR APP SECRET HERE',
    'FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_URL' : 'http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback'
  }
```

To get your ID and App Secret, go to the [Facebook developers page](https://developers.facebook.com/). Sign up for an account if you don't have one already, and go to "My Apps" in the top right -> "Add a New App".  Choose website, and enter a name for your app.  

Ignore the SDK step, and enter `localhost:3000` for the site URL.  

Then, if you click "Skip Quick Start" at the top of the page, it will direct you to your app dashboard.  

In the dashboard, at the bottom left column **Product Settings**, click **+Add Product**

Add **facebook Login**

Scroll down to **Client OAuth Settings** and enable **Embedded Browser OAuth Login**.  In the box for **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**, enter `localhost:3000`.  Save changes

Go back to the main Dashboard, and copy your **App ID** and **App Secret** into your `auth.js` file.

## Run the App

To run the example run 
```
npm install
```
then run 
```
node passport_example.js
```
The app should now be running on localhost:3000. If you head there, you should see a link to login with facebook. After login, if you head to /user the user's information should be displayed.
