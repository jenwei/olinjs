#### Preclass Reading and Exercise
Read the [Class 5 README](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/tree/master/lessons/05-client-jquery-ajax). Follow along and build the app starting at the "HTML Forms" section to the end.

To complete the preclass, push the app you create during the "HTML Forms" section" to your fork of the Olin.js repo. Then, send an email to [olinjs16@gmail.com](olinjs16@gmail.com) with the subject line "Preclass 5" and a link to the GitHub folder containing your forms app.

(The preclass is long -- if you can't get through all of it, at least get two forms working, then finish up the third in class).

If you're looking for an additional jQuery resource, this one is pretty good: [Basics of jQuery](http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics).
