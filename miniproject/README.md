# MiniProject: Mashup

## Intro
Most of the apps you've built so far (Twoter, Todo) have been clones of existing applications. This lab will be a bit different: you'll be combining key features of two existing apps into a "mashup" which does something new and exciting.

## Choosing Two Existing Apps
Here's a list of ideas to get you started - feel free to come up with others.
- Amazon
- Expedia
- Facebook
- Flickr
- Goodreads
- Netflix
- New York Times
- Pandora
- Trello
- Yelp
- Youtube

## Creating a Mashup
We _don't_ want you to copy every feature of both existing apps! Instead, pick out one or two key features of each. For instance, if you chose New York Times and Tinder, you might build something like [TinderTimes](http://tindertimes.herokuapp.com/). If you chose Google Maps and Soundcloud, you might build something like [DropTunes](http://droptune.herokuapp.com/#!/). If you chose Tinder and Spotify, you might build something like [Tindify](http://tindify.herokuapp.com/). These are all made by Olin.js Alums.

## Specifications
Your mashup should have:
- Recognizable features from two existing apps
- OAuth user authentication
- Nice styling and a reasonable user interface
- Documentation for each major component (minimum of a few sentences at the top of every file)
- You should host your app on heroku
- Use React, Babel and Webpack

We know that this isn't a particularly specific list of specifications - we're intentionally giving you room to be creative.
